üèóÔ∏è 2. Infrastructure Design
Azure Resources Used
‚Ä¢	AKS Cluster:
o	Minimum 3 nodes (auto-scaling enabled)
o	Private cluster access (optional, for secure environments)
‚Ä¢	Azure SQL DB: Premium tier with geo-redundancy
‚Ä¢	Application Gateway: Routes HTTPS traffic to Ingress
‚Ä¢	Public IP + DNS: For accessing the service (e.g., webapp.example.com)
‚Ä¢	Azure Key Vault: For secure secrets, API keys, DB creds
‚Ä¢	Azure Monitor & Log Analytics Workspace: Observability
‚Ä¢	Azure Container Registry: Store Docker images securely
‚Ä¢	Virtual Network (VNet): With subnets for AKS, SQL, Gateway

    participant WebApp as Web Service Pod
    participant SQL as Azure SQL DB
    participant API as External Services (via Azure API Mgmt)

    User->>AppGW: HTTPS Request (webapp.example.com)
    AppGW->>Ingress: Forward via Internal Load Balancer
    Ingress->>WebApp: Route to web service pod
    WebApp->>SQL: Read/Write Data (via Private Link)
    WebApp->>API: Fetch Data (via Azure API Management)

üîÑ 5. CI/CD (Azure DevOps Pipelines)
CI Pipeline ‚Äì Triggers on code push
‚Ä¢	Checkout code
‚Ä¢	Run tests (unit, Selenium if needed)
‚Ä¢	Lint & scan via SonarQube
‚Ä¢	Build Docker image
‚Ä¢	Push to ACR
CD Pipeline ‚Äì Triggers on successful build
‚Ä¢	Pull manifests from Git repo
‚Ä¢	Authenticate to AKS
‚Ä¢	kubectl apply -f all YAMLs
‚Ä¢	Deploy TLS certs via cert-manager
‚Ä¢	Rollout with Blue-Green or Canary strategy
________________________________________
üîê 6. Security
‚Ä¢	HTTPS via Let's Encrypt + cert-manager
‚Ä¢	Azure Key Vault for sensitive variables
‚Ä¢	Azure RBAC for AKS access
‚Ä¢	Private endpoint for Azure SQL DB
‚Ä¢	WAF + API Management for external integrations
________________________________________
üìä 7. Monitoring & Alerts
‚Ä¢	Helm Install:
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm install monitoring prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack
‚Ä¢	Dashboards: CPU, Memory, RPS, SQL DB usage
‚Ä¢	Alerts: Slack/Teams or Email using AlertManager
________________________________________
‚ö° 8. Integration with External Services
For integrating external services such as third-party APIs (payment services, email providers, etc.), the solution uses Azure API Management (APIM). This approach allows us to:
‚Ä¢	Throttle requests to prevent abuse
‚Ä¢	Securely manage API keys using Azure Key Vault
‚Ä¢	Monitor traffic and create usage plans
‚Ä¢	Provide a unified API gateway for external integrations
Key Points:
‚Ä¢	API Key management: APIM and Key Vault ensure that API keys and secrets are stored securely.
‚Ä¢	Rate limiting: Set up quotas and rate limits to manage traffic and avoid service overloading.
‚Ä¢	Logging and monitoring: Azure Monitor provides observability on external API calls and helps ensure seamless integrations.

üí• 9. High Availability & Fault Tolerance
To ensure high availability and fault tolerance, the system leverages the following:
1. AKS Cluster (3+ nodes, auto-scaling)
‚Ä¢	Node Pool Auto-scaling: Scales nodes dynamically based on load.
‚Ä¢	Pod Distribution: Pods are distributed across multiple nodes and availability zones to ensure redundancy.
2. SQL Database High Availability
‚Ä¢	Geo-replication: SQL database is configured for geo-redundancy, ensuring disaster recovery in case of regional failures.
‚Ä¢	Auto-failover: In case of a failure, Azure SQL automatically fails over to a secondary region.
3. Ingress Controller & Load Balancing
‚Ä¢	NGINX Ingress ensures traffic is distributed evenly across pods.
‚Ä¢	Azure Application Gateway ensures secure traffic routing to AKS and performs SSL termination.
4. Application Gateway with WAF
‚Ä¢	Web Application Firewall (WAF) protects against DDoS and other external threats.
‚Ä¢	Global Load Balancing: Routes traffic intelligently to ensure minimal latency and high availability.
5. Backup & Disaster Recovery
‚Ä¢	Database Backups: SQL database backups are taken at regular intervals, with automated recovery.
‚Ä¢	Pod Redundancy: Multiple replicas ensure that service continues even if one pod or node fails.

‚úÖ Summary
This solution ensures a highly available, secure, scalable, and fault-tolerant web service infrastructure using Azure's native tools and best practices. It also provides a clear path for integrating external services and ensures that the system can handle failures gracefully with high availability strategies.
